# Advent of Code 2018

By: *Christopher Dilley*

Languages: *Rust*, *Python*

This repository contains all code related to my participation in [Advent of Code 2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018).

I've started out programming in Rust, but for the most part my solutions are in Python due to time constraints.  Comment quality and quantity will vary depending on my commenting mood on a given day.

As this is my first time programming in Rust, I apologize in advance for any eye damage caused by attempting to read any of the code.
